        At InternPark, our mission is to Nurture India's Young Talent.
        For young individuals between the ages of 19 to 25, we offer a dedicated Internship
        Pathway aimed at constructing a robust profile for college and MBA
        applications. Through this program, participants engage in internships that provide
        valuable hands-on experience and skill development. This pathway serves as a stepping
        stone, empowering young talents to stand out in academic and professional
        pursuits. These can be paid or unpaid internships.
        We have students from top Indian and international institutions waiting to apply classroom
        knowledge to real-world scenarios during these summer months, providing a unique and enriching
        perspective on the dynamics of the Indian business landscape.
